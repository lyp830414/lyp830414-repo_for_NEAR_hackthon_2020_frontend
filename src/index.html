      <h2 id="problemstatement">Problem Statement</h2>

      <p>The biggest value add for car driving assisting system is the smooth lane keeping.</p>

      <h3 id="reward">Reward</h3>

      <p>Good driving is rarely rewarded other than safety itself.
        Karma aims to provide quality training dataset for auto makers and monetary incentives for the drivers. </p>

      <h3 id="drivingrecordownership">Driving Record Ownership</h3>

      <p>Auto company takes ownership of your driving records, trains a driving assisting system, and sells that system
        back to you.</p>

      <p>A more rational solution is auto company pays for good work on driving, hence ending the dataset deprivation
        and encouraging safe driving.</p>

      <h2 id="priorworks">Prior Works</h2>

      <h3 id="chffr">Chffr</h3>

      <p>Chffr (now discontinued) is a dashcam app for your car. You can use this app to record your drives with panda,
        earn comma points and help teach self driving cars how to drive.

      <h2 id="solutionproposal">Solution Proposal</h2>

      <p>A mobile application that rewards the driver for smooth driving with NEAR protocol.</p>

      <h3 id="usecase">Use Case</h3>

      <p>Yifei opens the Karma application on his Android Phone.
        He navigates himself home.
        Karma starts to record his driving and communicate to his car through the comma two devkit.
        He can see an incremental counter on his Karma points and tries to keep it as high as possible by driving as
        smooth as possible.
        When he finished his trip home, Karma accredits his account bases off his driving quality.
        Yifei may choose to cash out those Karma points, trade for coupon or promos, or set them on bidding to trade
        with other Karma drivers.</p>

      <p>We propose a Mobile App solution which records and uploads good driving records.</p>
      <p>When there is a Dart package available, we will give it a shot.</p>
